💡 Why I Code
For me, coding isn’t just a skill — it’s something I genuinely love. I enjoy the process of thinking through problems, building solutions from scratch, and seeing them come to life. There’s a special kind of satisfaction that comes from turning an idea into a working product — whether it’s a backend system, a chatbot, or even a small game.
I started coding out of curiosity, but over time it became much more than that. It’s become my way of thinking, creating, and expressing myself. Every challenge I face in code teaches me something — about logic, about systems, and even about myself. I find joy in every line of code.
